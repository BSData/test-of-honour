[Overview]: #overview

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]


## Reporting bugs & contact us ##
[Reporting bugs & contact us]: #reporting-bugs--contact-us

  1. [Report it on Appspot][] - it's anonymous and no account is needed - one downside, you will need to manually check the progress of your issue.
  2. [Open Issue directly][] (green ```New Issue``` in upper-right) - you need a GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (i.e. answer our questions) and help us better!

[Report it on Appspot]: http://battlescribedata.appspot.com/#/repo/wh40k
[Open Issue directly]: https://github.com/BSData/wh40k/issues
